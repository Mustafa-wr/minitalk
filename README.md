# minitalk
minitalk is a programming project at 42 that involves writing a client-server application in C that can send and receive messages between two processes using only signals. The minitalk project requires you to implement inter-process communication, handle signal interrupts, and manage memory allocation in C. It is a relatively long project that tests your understanding of low-level programming concepts, such as system calls, signals, and memory management. The minitalk project provides a valuable opportunity to practice implementing advanced communication protocols and low-level programming concepts in C.
